**COMP20290 REPOSITORY**
This repository shows the working of the algorithms taught in this module.

**Prerequisites**
Java SDK 13 is required. 

**The Project**
This project implements the following:
1)Russian Peasant
2)ThreeSumA and ThreeSumB
3)Fibonacci Recursive and iterative
4)Selection Sort
5)Insertion Sort
6)Bogo Sort
7)Merge Sort (and its enhanced version)
8)Quick Sort (and its enhanced version)
9)Brute Force algorithm
10)KMP Search
11)Towers of Hanoi
12)Tries
13)Compression
 Each package contains the algorithms done in the corresponding practical.

 An excel file is also submitted which contains the analysis of the performance of these algorithms.

**Running the tests**
Main function of each class is used to test the algorithms implemented in the class.
No additional test files were used.

**Break down into end to end tests**
The tests run the algorithm for which the input is supplied explicitly.
The time taken by the algorithm is also calculated and their performance is analysed.

**Built With**
ItelliJ IDE was used for this project

**Versioning**
GitHub is used for versioning
