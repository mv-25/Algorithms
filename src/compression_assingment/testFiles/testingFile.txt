When we think of the word “Language”, communication comes to mind; activities that vocalise
our thoughts and emotions. Aristotle said that man is a rational animal and what sets him apart,
raises him above the animals, is that he can reason, and he cannot reason without language. But
is language just limited to listening, processing, and speaking? It is safe to say that language is
essential to define the core of human experience and civilisation. It is a whole world in itself.
Its birth, how it evolved over the centuries, the science behind it, and the various diverse
communities it sustains, all come together to form a captivating story about it. Language thus
became an indispensable social tool; inseparable and dependent on the people who are its
curators. Having established the role of language, it is natural to question if thoughts are
dependent on it and if the language that we’ve grown up with, really influences how we think.
We need to analyse its implications, and how it is related to our thought process and
interpretation of the reality in which we find ourselves.
The answer to the question of this essay, whether thought is possible without language,
depends on what one means by the word "thought". Is it possible to experience impressions,
sensations, feelings without the crutch of language? Or does it refer to ideas, beliefs, and
opinions? Being able to experience a feeling or sensation, and possessing the concepts of said
emotions are independent, often overlapping, qualities.
We can argue that thoughts are just a voice in our heads that narrate our surroundings. We are
continually thinking, conversing with that voice, and subsequently giving thoughts a life via
language. These narrations may present themselves in the form of abstract images and words
whose existence is bound to our minds. Or are they a conscious version of our dreams? After
all, they allow us to be able to conceptualise the world around us with our definitions, giving
a unique meaning to our experiences. A real thought entails having these comprehensive
concepts.
Among the early approaches to examining the relationship between language and thought, the
behaviourists believed that thought was nothing more than speech. Linguists Sapir and Whorf
thought that this idea of the relationship between objective reality and language is a mere
illusion. They believed that people around the globe speak different languages, with various
structural features and vocabularies, and this influences the conceptual system they bring to
each experience of the world.
The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, named after the American linguist Edward Sapir and Benjamin
Lee Whorf, is classified as mould theory of language. In 1929, Sapir presented his belief,
"The linguistic relativity principle" that the varying cultural concepts and categories inherent
in different languages affect the cognitive classification of the experienced world in such a
way that speakers of other languages think and behave differently because of it. It also

mentioned that as other languages have different structures; barrier free communication
between cross-cultural groups would pose a difficulty as their language restricts their way of
thinking. The notion that linguistic structure influences the cognition of language users has
stirred a commotion in a lot of scientific fields such as anthropological linguistics,
psychology, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, cognitive science, linguistic anthropology,
sociology of Language and Philosophy of Language. Indubitably it has been the subject of
extensive studies in all of these fields. The idea of linguistic influences on thought has also
captivated the minds of authors and creative artists inspiring numerous ideas in literature, in
the creation of artificial languages and even forms of therapy such as neuro-linguistic
programming.
Whorf: "... we cut nature up, organise it into concepts and describe significances as
we do, largely because we are party to an agreement which holds in the pattern of
our language."

The idea that our thoughts depend on language might strike as irrational. In contrast, a more
rational belief would be that perception of the world and our surroundings is simply a
relationship between our sensory systems and objective reality. Even if we include the effect
of culture, personal experience, and upbringing, the grammar or vocabulary of the languages
you speak or know plays no role in shaping how one thinks about the world. Language is how
you give voice to what you experience or what you think, not a determining force on what or
how you feel about an experience. It is easily observed that the majority of species are clearly
able to solve many problems without language.
However, the construction of language is not spread uniformly around the globe. Living in
different context makes people from other parts of the world to perceive reality differently.
The social and environmental context influences their way of living and thought. A person
may perceive the context in different ways; their use of words is instead limited to and
depends on that particular context. People growing up in the same surrounding and speaking
the same language can possess different thoughts and communicate other ideas which
contradict with Sapir’s Hypothesis. The issue of linguistic relativism and the impact of
language on our take on reality is a vast field and leads to the questioning of many concepts
that we may often overlook; considering them not useful.
One of those concepts is gendering via language and how it gravely builds our way of seeing
and interpreting the world. As feminism gained momentum, people turned to language to
denounce it as the root of inequalities and sexism. Ripping off the very hearts of the language
had the potential of changing what we perceive as a “man-made” language. It is still an
ongoing battle as it is incredibly resistant to change and subject to norms. It heavily affects
our mentalities, since stereotyping and labelling individuals act the way that we perceive
them. This debate notably explains the attention that has been brought in those circles to the
supposedly "gender-neutral" use of masculine words in languages such as English (for
instance, the use of the word "man" or "mankind" for human), Italian, Spanish or French (the
masculine plural pronouns to refer to a group of people made up of at least one man), which
can be blamed to contribute further to the invisibility of women. The increasingly common
use of the word "gender" as a social construction as opposed to sex, not as a grammatical
category is evidence itself of the use of an alternative language to draw further attention to
